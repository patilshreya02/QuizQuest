 I am delving into the world of Flutter development, focusing on both Stateful and Stateless Widgets. Additionally, I am exploring the fundamental building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes and Objects.

Widgets in Flutter
Stateful Widgets
Stateful Widgets are dynamic and can change over time in response to user interactions or other factors. They maintain a mutable state that can be updated and redrawn, making them ideal for components that need to reflect real-time changes. Examples include forms, interactive lists, and animations.

Stateless Widgets
Stateless Widgets, on the other hand, are immutable once they are built. Their appearance and properties remain constant throughout the lifecycle of the widget. They are perfect for static content where no change in state is needed, such as text labels, icons, or static images.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is a foundational paradigm in software development that revolves around the concept of classes and objects. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key concepts:

Classes: Serve as blueprints for creating objects, encapsulating data and methods to manipulate that data.
Objects: Instances of classes that represent real-world entities and their interactions.
Inheritance: A mechanism to create a new class using the properties and methods of an existing class.
Encapsulation: The bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit or class.
Abstraction: The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
Polymorphism: The ability of different objects to respond in their own way to the same message or method call.
